# Contributing

Want to ask a question? Check out the [discussions].

## What should I know before I get started?

Check to see if you're contribution has already been discussed. Open a
question in the discussion with a suggestion of what you intend to do.

## How can I contribute

All contributions are welcome, from typo corrections to new features.

If you're adding a new component to `src/lib/components` then add the
export to `src/lib/index.ts`.
